## Getting Started

Here's a sample `docker-compose.yml` to get started
```yml
services:
  jetlog:
    image: pbogre/jetlog:latest
    volumes:
      - /your/data/path:/data
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    environment:
      SECRET_KEY: "change_me"
```

The `SECRET_KEY` can be generated by a command such as 
- `openssl rand -base64 64 | tr -d '\ n'` (generates a 64 character length key)
- `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"` (generates a 32 byte length key)
